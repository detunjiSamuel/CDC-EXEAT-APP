## About


This project aims help covenant university students with their weekly course evaluation. 

## Why

The average student in covenant university has about 14 courses enrolled in every semester and has on avarage about 5 lecturers assigned to the course.
I realised that answering 31 questions for each lecturer would take about 1hr minutes with okay internet speed that would mean a student would spend about 12 hours doing the same repetitive task in a semester(let's be honest no student actually reads the questions ). So i thought i should automate the process.

## achivement

I was able to cut down this repetitive process to 4 seconds(Best case) and 15 seconds(worst case) per week.
The time is dependent on internet speed and covenant university server's reponse
